		<h5>Agri-food traceability system</h5>
		<p>Australia is a big agricultural country, agriculture is its pillar industry, and its agricultural products enjoy a high reputation in the world. In contrast,
		 the reputation of its products overseas is often damaged, and the lack of supportive product traceability technology leads to a decline in the quality of 
		 its products in the sales process. The company combines GIS, VR and BLOCKCHAIN technologies to build a set of fast, reliable, and production monitoring protocols,
		  and is expected to be released and promoted within the next 
		two years. </p>
